    "The rapid growth of Next Generation Sequencing technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) demands efficient parallel processing and analysis of big data. Hadoop and Spark are the goto opensource frameworks for storing and processing massive datasets. The most significant advantage of Spark is its iterative analytics capability combined with in-memory computing architecture. Calling .cache() on a resilient distributed dataset (RDD) effectively saves it in memory and makes it instantly available for computation, thus the subsequent filter, map, and reduce tasks become instantaneous. Spark has its query language known as Spark SQL, and its MLlib library is highly desirable for machine learning tasks."
